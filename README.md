# Analyzing the Time x Energy Relation in C++ Solutions Mined from a Programming Contest Site

## What is this?

This repository contains the source code of C++ solutions mined from the Code Submission Evaluation System (CSES).

It contains folders related to 15 different CSES problems, where each folder contains 30 different C++ solutions. The complete list of CSES problems is available in [CSES_problems](/CSES_problems.md).


## Folder Structure

The main folder contains 17 subfolders: 
1. 15 subfolders (one for each CSES problem).
2. A subfolder `RAPL`, which contains the code related to the time/energy measurement framework. The running time of a program is measured based on a wall-clock timer.
3. A subfolder `RAPL-time`, which contains the code related to the time/energy measurement framework. The running time of a program is measured based on a cpu timer.
4. A subfolder `analysis-script`, which contains Python scripts to analyze the data generated by the time/energy measuring tool. 

The code in subfolders `RAPL` and `RAPL-time` is mostly based on the one provided by the [Green Software Lab](https://github.com/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages).

Each folder related to a CSES problem has a `Makefile`, a subfolder `test`, with input files related to the problem, and the subfolders `slow`, `fast`, `rand`, `rand30` and `control` which contain C++ solutions for the given problem with the following configuration:
- `slow`: the 10 slowest C++ solutions.
- `fast': the 10 fastest C++ solutions.
- `rand`: 10 C++ solutions chosen at random.
- `rand30`: 30 C++ solutions (different from `rand`) chosen at random.
- `control`: 10 C++ solutions (different from `rand` and `rand30`) chosen at random.

During our experiments, we considered the following **datasets**:
- `slow`: which consists of the C++ solutions in subfolders `slow`, `fast` and `rand`
- `rand30`: which consists of the C++ solutions in subfolder `rand30`
- `control`: which consists of the C++ solutions in subfolder `control`

In the folder of each CSES problem there are `.csv` files related to the energy measurements performed.
Thes names of these files have the following structure: **PROBLEM_NUMBER-MACHINE-DATASET-TIME_MEASUREMENT**.

Below, we present some examples of these files:
- 1621-HPELITE-control-time.csv: data related to CSES problem *1621*, where the measurement was performed at machine *HPELITE* for the *control* dataset, using a *cpu-based* timer.
- 1082-HPTHINK-slow-clock.csv: data related to CSES problem *1082*, where the measurement was performed at machine *HPTHINK* for the *slow* dataset, using a *wall-clock* timer.


## Compiling/Running the C++ Solutions

The files in this repository were compiled in a Linux/Ubuntu environment
using versions of the `g++` compiler with support to the **C++17** standard.

To start measuring the time/energy of the CSES solutions, the first step is to compile the measurement framework.
You should enter the `RAPL` and `RAPL-time` folders and type `make`.

After this, you should enter a folder related to a CSES problem (e.g., *cses-1084_Apartments*) and edit the
Makefile to select the subfolders with C++ solutions that will be measured.

Then, we should log in as `root` (this is necessary for increasing the amount of memory that a
program can use, and for the energy measurements) , and then type `./faztudo` at the command line.
This will compile and run all solutions for the given problem in the selected subfolders against
each test file of the corresponding `test` subfolder. By default, we will run each solution ten times against
the corresponding testset.

The energy measurements of the solutions for a given problem will be stored in a .csv file
whose name can be configured by changing the value of the variable `PROBLEM` in the
first line of the corresponding outermost `Makefile`. For example, if we associate the
name "1084" with variable `PROBLEM`, our measurements will be stored at a file `1084.csv`.

Each line of the .csv containg six columns related to the following information:

Name of the executable file , PKG (Joules) , CPU (J) , GPU (J) , DRAM (J) , Time (ms)

RAPL will also report values for the columns PKG and CPU, but the measurements related
to GPU and DRAM may not be available in some machines.



## Using the Analysis Script

To use the analysis script, enter in the folder of a problem and type the following command:
```
python ../analysis-script/analisacsvs.py <file>.csv
```

You can also provide multiple .csv files to the analysis script. In this case, you should provide
an even number **2 * N** of files. The script will consider that the first **N** files
are related to a machine, while the others are related to a different machine, and it will
compare the outliers in files **1, 2, ..., N** with the outliers in files **N+1, N+2, ..., N+N**.

The analysis script creates a subfoder `analysis_results` where it will store several
auxiliary files generated during the analysis.
