# Analyzing the Time x Energy Relation in C++ Solutions Mined from a Programming Contest Site

## What is this?

This repository contains the source code of C++ solutions mined from the Code Submission Evaluation System (CSES).

It contains folders related to 15 different CSES problems, where each folder contains 30 different C++ solutions. The complete list of CSES problems is available in [CSES_problems](/CSES_problems.md).

## Folder structure and how to compile/run the files


### The Structure

The main folder contains 17 subfolders: 
1. 15 subfolders (one for each CSES problem).
2. A subfolder `RAPL`, which contains the code related to the time/energy measurement framework.
This code is mostly based on the one provided by the [Green Software Lab](https://github.com/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages).
3. A subfolder `analysis-script`, which contains Python scripts to analyze the data generated by the time/energy measuring tool. 

Each folder related to a CSES problem has a `Makefile`, a subfolder `test`, with input files related to the problem, and the subfolders `slow`, `fast` and `lang`, which contain C++ solutions for the given problem.
Subfolder `slow` has the 10 slowest C++ solutions, while subfolder `fast` has the 10 fastest ones,
and subfolder `lang` has 10 C++ solutions chosen at random.

Moreover, in the folder of each CSES problem there are the following files related to energy measurements
performed in two different machines (*HPTHINK* and *HPELITE*) by using different C++ flags (-O0, -O2 and -Os):
- 1621-HPELITE-O0.csv
- 1621-HPELITE-O2.csv
- 1621-HPELITE-Os.csv
- 1621-HPTHINK-O0.csv
- 1621-HPTHINK-O2.csv
- 1621-HPTHINK-Os.csv


### Compiling/Running the C++ Solutions

The files in this repository were compiled in a Linux/Ubuntu environment
using versions of the `g++` compiler with support to the **C++17** standard.

To start measuring the time/energy of the CSES solutions, the first step is to compile the measurement framework.
You should enter the `RAPL` folder and type `make`.

After this, you should enter a folder related to a CSES problem (e.g., *cses-1084_Apartments*) and type `make`.
This will compile and run all solutions for the given problem in the associated `slow`, `fast` and `lang` subfolders.

After compiling a solution, and before running it, the following command will also be executed:
```
sudo modprobe msr
```

Such command enables us to read the RAPL energy measurements.

When executing the outermost `Makefile` of a given problem, each solution of each subfolder
(`slow`, `fast` and `lang`) will be compiled and then executed for each test file of the
corresponding `test` subfolder. By default, we will run each solution ten times against
the corresponding testset.

The energy measurements of the solutions for a given problem will be stored in a .csv file
whose name can be configured by changing the value of the variable `PROBLEM` in the
first line of the corresponding outermost `Makefile`. By default, the results for a problem whose
number is X will be saved in a file `X.csv`. For example, the energy measurements for
*cses-1084_Apartments* will be stored in a file `1084.csv`.

Each line of the .csv containg six columns related to the following information:

Name of the executable file , PKG (Joules) , CPU (J) , GPU (J) , DRAM (J) , Time (ms)

RAPL will also report values for the columns PKG and CPU, but the measurements related
to GPU and DRAM may not be available in some machines.
