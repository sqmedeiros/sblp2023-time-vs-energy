# Analyzing the Time x Energy Relation in C++ Solutions Mined from a Programming Contest Site

## What is this?

This repository contains the source code of C++ solutions mined from the Code Submission Evaluation System (CSES).

It contains folders related to 15 different CSES problems, where each folder contains 30 different C++ solutions. The complete list of CSES problems is available in [CSES_problems](/CSES_problems).

## Folder structure and how to compile/run the files


### The Structure

The main folder contains 17 subfolders: 
1. 15 subfolders (one for each CSES problem).
2. A subfolder `RAPL`, which contains the code related to the time/energy measurement framework.
This code is mostly based on the one provided by the [Green Software Lab](https://github.com/greensoftwarelab/Energy-Languages).
3. A subfolder `analysis-script`, which contains Python scripts to analyze the data generated by the time/energy measuring tool. 

Each folder related to a CSES problem has a `Makefile`, a subfolder `test`, with input files related to the problem, and the subfolders `slow`, `fast` and `lang`, which contain C++ solutions for the given problem.
Subfolder `slow` has the 10 slowest C++ solutions, while subfolder `fast` has the 10 fastest ones,
and subfolder `lang` has 10 C++ solutions chosen at random.



### Compiling/Running

To start measuring the time/energy of the CSES solutions, the first step is to compile the measurement framework.
You should enter the `RAPL` folder and type `make`.

After this, you should enter a folder related to a CSES problem and type `make`.
This will compile and run all solutions in the associated `slow`, `fast` and `lang` subfolders.

After typing `make`, the following command will also be executed:
```
sudo modprobe msr
```
